# tail_inference_extremes

The code is based on the study of extremal dependence through L^1 minimization, developed by Meyer and Wintenberger (2020+).

A first example deals with an asymptotic independent case, with Gaussian dependence and Pareto(1) marginals.
A second example deals with a dependent case which provides a discrete spectral measure.
Finally we apply our procedure to extreme variability for financial data.
